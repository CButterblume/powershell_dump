## If Get-BLConfigDBVariables is called with the "-Defaults" argument, the values specifed here are taken as default settings for the variables, 
## and can be overwritten by values from the ConfigDB during import.
## Define a value of "@error@" to make sure the variable is defined in the ConfigDb; if the variable is missing in the ConfigDB, 
## Get-BLConfigDBVariables will automatically throw an error during import.
##
## Please create an entry for EVERY ConfigDB variable your packet uses (if possible), 
## in order to be able to use this file for consistency checks during the generation of *.cfg files from the ConfigDB.
